NAME
    YAML::DocumentIterator

SYNOPSIS
      my $data = YAML::DocumentIterator->new( 'data.yaml' );
      while ( $data->isnt_exhausted ) {
          my $datum = $data->value;
          # ...do something with $datum
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a small wrapper around "YAML::Syck::Load" to read
    and parse a YAML file one record at a time. This is sometimes preferable
    to the behaviour of "YAML::LoadFile", "YAML::Syck::LoadFile", and
    "YAML::XS::LoadFile" which read the entire file into memory before
    parsing.

    This module uses the (optional) document start marker "---" to detect
    record boundaries and will not behave as expected if these markers are
    not present in your input file.

METHODS
    new(*$file*)
        Constructor. *$file* can be either an open IO::Handle or the name of
        a file to be opened for reading. Returns an Iterator object.

SEE ALSO
    YAML::Syck, Iterator.
